          The fifth European Data & Computational Journalism Conference aims to bring together industry, practitioners and academics in the fields of journalism and news production.
        </p>

        <p>
          This unique conference focused on information, data, social and
          computer sciences, facilitating a multidisciplinary discussion on
          these topics in order to advance research and practice in the broad
          area of Data and Computational Journalism. This is a venue where
          <strong>journalists and researchers</strong> meet, news organisations
          share experiences with computational and social scientists, and
          together explore new kinds of practices that can serve the public
          good. The conference will present a mix of academic talks and keynotes
          from industry leaders.
        </p>

        <p>
          This will be the 5th edition of the European Data and Computational
          Journalism Conference (datajconf).
