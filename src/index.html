            <h1>The Conference</h1>
            <p>The Joint <strong>Computation+Journalism</strong> and <strong>European Data & Computational Journalism Conference</strong> aims to bring together
            industry, practitioners and academics in the fields of journalism and news production. It will be hosted on
                <div class="centred">June 23-24<br>at ETH Zurich, Switzerland<br>workshops on June 22nd</div></p>

            <p>This unique conference will focus on information, data, social and computer sciences, facilitating a multidisciplinary discussion on these topics in order to advance research and practice in the broad area of Data and Computational Journalism. This is a venue where journalists and researchers meet –— news organisations share experiences with computational and social scientists, and together explore new kinds of practices that can serve the public good. The conference will present a mix of academic talks and keynotes from industry leaders.</p>
            <img src="img/cover/eth2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>This is the 10th edition of the Computation+Journalism Symposium (C+J), and the 4th edition of the European Data and Computational Journalism Conference (datajconf), held together jointly for the first time in 2023 in Zurich, Switzerland. It is also the first time that the C+J Symposium will be held outside of the US.
            <div class="centred"><p>Registration for the conference is open to all (online registration coming soon)</p></div>

            <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
            <p>The first Joint Computation + Journalism Symposium / European Computational and Data Journalism Conference aims to bring
            together a wide range of academics and industry practitioners for a large-scale inclusive event to discuss, present and
            learn about new research and practice in the broad fields of computational and data journalism. We hope to attract
            researchers with curiosity about journalism, as well as news organisations looking to expand their reporting
            capabilities or experiment with new ways to generate, present or distribute stories.</p>

            <p>We invite the submission of both academic, research-focused and industry-focused talks and sessions for the conference,
            on the subjects of journalism, data journalism, and information, data, social and computer sciences. Talks and sessions
            might cover a tool or methodology that could support new kinds of reporting or storytelling. Perhaps you are a social
            scientist with a new way to think about public opinion. Or you are a researcher in the digital humanities with a fresh
            approach to thinking about collections of texts, identifying who they are about and the situations they describe. Or you
            are a media artist with a new visualisation of event-based data, exploring the temporality of how things unfolded. You
            might consider proposing a complete session on the description of a significant collaboration between journalists and
            some other field, perhaps discussing the backstory to a complicated piece of reporting.</p>

            <p>You may contribute to the conference in different ways. You can propose a <strong>refereed paper</strong>, a <strong>contributed talk</strong>, a
            <strong>contributed session</strong>, or a <strong>contributed workshop</strong>. In general, proposals should explore the interface between computing,
            data and journalism, covering the entire process and practice of journalism in context. Topics of interest include, but
            are not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Application of data and computational journalism within newsrooms</li>

                <ul>
        <li>Propose a contributed workshop with an abstract of at most 250 words. These are training sessions led by journalists or
        researchers, introducing a topic of interest to the community.</li>
        <li>Propose a contributed talk with an abstract of at most 250 words. These separate talks will be divided into sessions by
        the Program Committee and run in parallel at the event.</li>

        and the session organiser should submit a similar abstract describing the overall topic of the session.</li>
        <li>Propose a refereed paper with a three to five-page PDF. These talks will also be divided into sessions but will be given
        a special place in the program.</li>
        <li>The Program Committee will organise several invited sessions.</li>
        <li>The Program Committee will invite a slate of keynote speakers.</li>
