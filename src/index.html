        <h3>Accepted Speakers Travel</h3>
        <p>As a joint academic/industry conference we are sometimes asked about the ability to pay travel expenses for accepted speakers from industry. Unfortunately, as is usual with an academic conference we are unable to offer this facility - we would expect employers to cover these costs. Our preference is to keep ticket prices as low as possible to enable as many different people to attend the conference - if we were to cover travel expenses for industry speakers then ticket prices would have to rise substantially.</p>
