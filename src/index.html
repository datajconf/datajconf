                <p>The Joint Computation+Journalism/European Data & Computational Journalism Conference aims to bring together industry, practitioners and academics in the fields of journalism and news production and information, data, social and computer sciences, facilitating a multidisciplinary discussion on these topics in order to advance research and practice in the broad area of Data and Computational Journalism. This is a venue where journalists and researchers meet â€” news organizations share experiences with computational and social scientists, and together explore new kinds of practices that can serve the public good. The conference will present a mix of academic talks and keynotes from industry leaders.</p>
