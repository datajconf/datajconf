          The fifth European Data & Computational Journalism Conference aims to bring together industry, practitioners and academics in the fields of journalism and news production.
        </p>

        <p>
          This unique conference focused on information, data, social and
          computer sciences, facilitating a multidisciplinary discussion on
          these topics in order to advance research and practice in the broad
          area of Data and Computational Journalism. This is a venue where
          <strong>journalists and researchers</strong> meet, news organisations
          share experiences with computational and social scientists, and
          together explore new kinds of practices that can serve the public
          good. The conference will present a mix of academic talks and keynotes
          from industry leaders.
        </p>

        <p>
          This will be the 5th edition of the European Data and Computational
          Journalism Conference (datajconf).

        <p>The fifth European Computational and Data Journalism Conference aims to bring together a wide range of academics and industry practitioners for a large-scale inclusive event to discuss, present and learn about new research and practice in the broad fields of computational and data journalism. We hope to attract researchers with curiosity about journalism, as well as news organisations looking to expand their reporting capabilities or experiment with new ways to generate, present or distribute stories.
        </p>
        <p>We invite the submission of both academic, research-focused and industry-focused talks and sessions for the conference, on the subjects of journalism, data journalism, and information, data, social and computer sciences and artificial intelligence. Talks and sessions might cover a tool or methodology that could support new kinds of reporting or storytelling. Perhaps you are a social scientist with a new way to think about public opinion. Or you are a researcher in the digital humanities with a fresh approach to thinking about collections of texts, identifying who they are about and the situations they describe. Or you are a media artist with a new visualisation of event-based data, exploring the temporality of how things unfolded. You might consider proposing a complete session on the description of a significant collaboration between journalists and some other field, perhaps discussing the backstory to a complicated piece of reporting.</p>
        <p>You may contribute to the conference in different ways. You can propose a refereed paper, a contributed talk, a contributed session, or a contributed workshop. In general, proposals should explore the interface between computing, data and journalism, covering the entire process and practice of journalism in context. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
          <ul>
            <li>Application of data and computational journalism within newsrooms</li>
            <li>Automated, robot and chatbot journalism, AI in the newsroom</li>
            <li>Data driven investigations</li>
            <li>Data storytelling</li>
            <li>Open data for journalism, storytelling, transparency and accountability</li>
            <li>Algorithms, transparency and accountability</li>
            <li>Newsroom software and tools</li>
            <li>‘Post-fact’ journalism and the impact of data</li>
            <li>User experience and interactivity</li>
            <li>Data and Computational Journalism education and literacy</li>
            <li>Post-desktop news provision/interaction</li>
            <li>Data mining news sources</li>
            <li>Visualisation and presentation</li>
            <li>News games and gamification of News</li>
            <li>Bias, ethics, transparency and truth in Data Journalism</li>
            <li>Newsroom challenges with respect to data journalism, best practices, success and failure stories</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Forms of Participation:
          <ul>
            <li>Propose a contributed workshop with an abstract of at most 250 words. These are training sessions led by journalists or researchers, introducing a topic of interest to the community.</li>
            <li>Propose a contributed talk with an abstract of at most 250 words. These separate talks will be divided into sessions by the Program Committee and run in parallel at the event.</li>
            <li>Propose a contributed panel with three or four speakers. Each speaker will provide an abstract of at most 250 words, and the session organiser should submit a similar abstract describing the overall topic of the session.</li>
            <li>Propose a peer-reviewed paper with a three to five-page PDF. These talks will also be divided into sessions but will be given a special place in the program. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>All proposals should be submitted <a href="https://easychair.org/cfp/datajconf2025">through Easychair</a>, with a deadline of 16th May 2025</p>
