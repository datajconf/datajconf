                <p>The Joint Computation+Journalism and European Data & Computational Journalism Conference aims to bring together
                industry, practitioners and academics in the fields of journalism and news production. It will be hosted on
                    <div class="centred">June 23-24<br>at ETH Zurich, Switzerland<br>workshops on June 22nd</div></p>

                <p>This unique conference will focus on information, data, social and computer sciences, facilitating a multidisciplinary discussion on these topics in order to advance research and practice in the broad area of Data and Computational Journalism. This is a venue where journalists and researchers meet –— news organisations share experiences with computational and social scientists, and together explore new kinds of practices that can serve the public good. The conference will present a mix of academic talks and keynotes from industry leaders.</p>
