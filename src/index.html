                </p>

                <p>This unique conference will focus on information, data, social and computer sciences, facilitating a
                    multidisciplinary discussion on these topics in order to advance research and practice in the broad
                    area of Data and Computational Journalism. This is a venue where journalists and researchers meet –—
                    news organisations share experiences with computational and social scientists, and together explore
                    new kinds of practices that can serve the public good. The conference will present a mix of academic
                    talks and keynotes from industry leaders.</p>

                    The first Joint Computation + Journalism Symposium / European Computational and Data Journalism
                    Conference aims to bring together a wide range of academics and industry practitioners for a
                    large-scale inclusive event to discuss, present and learn about new research and practice in the
                    broad fields of computational and data journalism.

                        We hope to attract researchers with curiosity about journalism, as well as news organisations
                        looking to expand their reporting capabilities or experiment with new ways to generate, present
                        or
                        distribute stories.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We invite the submission of both academic, research-focused and industry-focused talks and sessions
                    for the conference, on the subjects of journalism, data journalism, and information, data, social
                    and computer sciences. Talks and sessions might cover a tool or methodology that could support new
                    kinds of reporting or storytelling.

                    Perhaps you are a social scientist with a new way to think about public opinion. Or you are a
                    researcher in the digital humanities with a fresh approach to thinking about collections of texts,
                    identifying who they are about and the situations they describe. Or you are a media artist with a
                    new visualisation of event-based data, exploring the temporality of how things unfolded. You might
                    consider proposing a complete session on the description of a significant collaboration between
                    journalists and some other field, perhaps discussing the backstory to a complicated piece of
                    reporting.
