              <h3>Data Visualisation for Everyone</h3>
              <p>The use of graphs, charts, maps, and infographics to explore data and communicate science to the public has become more and more popular among scientists and journalists alike. However, this rise in popularity has not been accompanied by an increasing awareness of the principles and rules that should guide the design of these visualizations.</p>
              <p>With facts and truth increasingly under assault, many interest groups have enlisted data visualization to support all manner of spin. Because digital images and graphics are inherently sharable and can quickly amplify messages, sifting through the visual information and misinformation is more critical than ever, and creating effective data visualizations without misleading viewers is an important skill for journalists — one that is within your reach, regardless of your background or budget.</p>

              <h3>Our Democracy Depends on How we Archive and Share Data</h3>
              <p>Data is getting to journalists at a massive scale due to electronic leaks. Recent examples are the Panama and the Paradise Papers, which amounted to four terabytes and 25 million files made available securely in the cloud to hundreds of reporters using open-source software. These exposés had unprecedented impact with high-level resignations and opened more than 150 investigations in 79 countries.</p>
              <p>The value of leaks like these doesn’t finish when the investigations are published. Connecting the dots between collections of leaked or public documents and data will become increasingly more important, so the conversation about how to archive and share them is crucial. If we don’t have it, our democracy will be in danger.</p>
